## Beat_Reactive_LED

- Connect LEDs to digital pins 11,12,13 of the Arduino.

- Copy-paste the **Arduino** and **Minim** folders from Libraries into your **Processing/libraries** folder.

- Take **Arduino IDE** & go to ***File -> Examples -> Firmata -> StandardFirmata***, and Upload the sketch to the Arduino. 

- Wait a few seconds, until your **RX/TX Leds** on your Arduino stop blinking _(which means the Firmata firmware is installed)_.

- Copy-paste an .mp3 file into the "***BeatWrite/data***" folder.

- Open **Processing IDE**, and then open the **BeatWrite.pde** file in it.

-  Edit the line of code "***song = minim.loadFile("Astronomia.mp3", 2048);***". Instead of using _"Astronomia.mp3"_, use the filename of your mp3.

- Hit the **Run** button on the top-left on the IDE, sit back, and enjoy the light show!
